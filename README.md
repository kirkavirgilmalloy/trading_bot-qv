[Download here](https://github.com/kirkavirgilmalloy/trading_bot-qv/releases)

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a **cryptocurrency trading bot** based on insights gained from historical data analysis.

Currently, the focus is on building a solid foundation for:
- Collecting and processing historical market data
- Performing quantitative analysis to explore potential trading strategies

This project is in its **early stages**, primarily centered around data acquisition and exploratory research. The trading logic will be implemented in later phases.

## Strategy Concepts (as of 2025-05-16)

The bot’s strategy will evolve over time, but the current conceptual direction is **statistical arbitrage** based on correlation patterns across different asset categories:

1. **Major Market Cap Coins**  
   _e.g._ BTC, ETH, XRP

2. **Functionally Similar Assets**  
   _e.g._ ETH, ADA, SOL, AVAX (smart contract platforms)

3. **Meme Coins**  
   There appear to be observable correlations — worth exploring further.

4. **TBD**  
   Additional strategies or refinements will be added as research progresses.
